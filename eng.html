    <h6 id="A1">Hello, welcome to this website, here, you will see several concepts about the countryside and its branches that correlate with the city, reflecting and opening wide ranges of opportunities for those who are interested in seeking an innovative future.</h6>

    <p id="Te1">Nowadays, the rural world plays an essential role on the planet and in our lives, being one of the main economic factors, the countryside produces tons of food and materials internationally and boosts various sectors such as transport, production, import and export.</p>
    <p id="Te1">All of this in a certain way is also related to the urban area, which in turn is where the majority of agricultural production is destined. Cities also help the rural sector with industries and technological tools for farmers and large landowners.</p>
    <p id="Te1">The city contributes with its infrastructure, economy and technology, while the countryside contributes with its production, food and sustainability.</p>

    <h1 class="T3">Opportunities</h1>
    <hr>
    <img id="I2" src="img/Oportunidades.png" alt="Search for opportunities"/>
    <p id="Te1">These factors generate an immense number of opportunities for entrepreneurs and young people, not only due to the great demand that exists for plantations and agricultural activities, but also due to the great technological innovation that has been emerging to operate in these environments, and for this we also need to innovate. These "Opportunities" will bring great benefits to people, but what are they?</p>
    <li class="Topicos"><strong>Economic development:</strong> In a larger scenario, we can have a perspective that these relationships generate a great benefit for the national and international economy.</li>
    <li class="Topicos"><strong>Export market:</strong> With the agricultural and import/export market in a beneficial set, individuals can support each other to bring cargo and shipments to each other, and thus drive an innovative hub in agribusiness.</li>
    <li class="Topicos"><strong>Cheap and varied foods:</strong> With the other contributing factors, food markets and distributors will have more varied and cheaper products, which in a way helps to combat hunger.</li>
    <li class="Topicos"><strong>Rural professions:</strong> With new technologies and innovations centered between the countryside and the city, new demands for professions begin to emerge and employ new people.</li>
    <li class="Topicos"><strong>Sustainable alternatives:</strong> In the midst of these conclusions, there is also a possibility of bringing sustainability to cities and even the countryside itself, with the reduction of pesticides and other pollutants, and the use of technologies to bring automation in production and in other environments in order to bring more clean environments.</li>
    <p id="Te1">Countless other opportunities also exist and can be explored in all of these areas!</p>
